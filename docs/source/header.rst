``flexdi`` is a yet another dependency injection library for Python.
``flexdi`` provides a lightweight alternative to common DI solutions
with minimal setup to be included in your projects. This library is
intended for use with type annotated Python libraries, as it leverages
these type annotations to perform injection.

.. note::
  | FlexDI is still a work in progress and is not yet intended
    for production use-cases.
  | Be aware that APIs are likely to change in upcoming releases.

See the `full documentation <https://flexdi.readthedocs.io>`_ for more details.
